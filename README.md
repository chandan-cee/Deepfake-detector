# Deepfake-detector
A powerful Deepfake Detection app built with Python, Streamlit, and deep learning. Upload an image and detect whether it's real or AI-generated in seconds.

This project is a deep learning-powered web application that detects whether an image is **real** or **AI-generated (fake)**.

Built with:
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for classification
- **Python** for backend logic
- **Streamlit** for a simple, interactive UI

Upload any image and instantly find out whether it's genuine or a deepfake â€” all processed locally!

##  Features

- Upload JPEG/PNG images
- Real vs Fake classification using a trained model
- Simple and clean Streamlit interface
- Local inference (no data sent to cloud)

##  Example

> Upload an image to see predictions like:
-  *"This image is Real"*
-  *"This image is a Deepfake!"*

##  Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Streamlit
- NumPy, OpenCV, PIL

Feel free to enhance or tweak depending on what model you're using or how advanced your features are. Want me to generate the full README with install instructions and usage too?
